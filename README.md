# Pictogen-AI
Explanation:
1. Library Installation: We install diffusers, transformers, and scipy for the necessary functions and models.
2. Image Loading: The image is downloaded using its URL and loaded into a PIL Image object.
3. Image Resizing: The image is resized to the new dimensions (1280x1280) to accommodate the additional 128 pixels on each side.
4. Model Loading: The stable-diffusion-2-inpainting model from Stability AI is loaded. This model is public and does not require authentication.
5. Mask Preparation: A mask is created where the new pixels will be added. The mask is white (255) in the areas to be inpainted and black (0) elsewhere.
6. Image Conversion: The image_resized and mask are converted to the correct formats (RGB and L respectively).
7. Inpainting: The model is used to fill in the new regions specified by the mask, generating a natural extension of the existing image.
8. Result Saving and Displaying: The final outpainted image is saved and displayed.
